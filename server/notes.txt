  1. Why are we setting the  "type": "module", in package.json file
By default, Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, where you use require() to import modules. However, with the introduction of ECMAScript Modules (ESM) in newer versions of Node.js (starting from version 13), you can use the import and export syntax commonly associated with JavaScript modules in the browser.
So by the use of "type": "module", in package.json file, we can use use the import and export syntax for modules consistently throughout your project.

import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import cors from 'cors';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import multer from "multer";
import helmet from "helmet";
import morgan from "morgan";
import path from 'path'
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

  Purpose: Import necessary Node.js modules and external libraries.

express: Web application framework for building APIs and web servers.
body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data in requests.
mongoose: MongoDB ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for interacting with MongoDB databases.
cors: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express.
dotenv: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, commonly used for file uploads.
helmet: Middleware for setting various HTTP headers to enhance security.
morgan: HTTP request logger middleware.
path: Module for working with file and directory paths.
fileURLToPath: Function for converting a file URL to a file system path.

3. const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
dotenv.config();
const app = express();

__filename and __dirname: Get the current file name and directory path.
dotenv.config(): Load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
app: Create an instance of the Express application.

4.app.use(express.json());
app.use(helmet());
app.use(helmet.crossOriginResourcePolicy({policy:'cross-origin'}));
app.use(morgan("common"));
app.use(bodyParser.json({limit:"30mb",extended:true}))
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({limit:"30mb",extended:true}))
app.use(cors())
app.use("/assets",express.static(path.join(__dirname,'public/assets')))

Purpose: Set up various Express middlewares to handle different aspects of the incoming requests.

express.json(): Parse incoming JSON requests.
helmet(): Set various HTTP headers for security.
helmet.crossOriginResourcePolicy({policy:'cross-origin'}): Configure cross-origin resource policy.
morgan("common"): Use the "common" format for HTTP request logging.
bodyParser.json() and bodyParser.urlencoded(): Parse JSON and URL-encoded data in requests bodies.
cors(): Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
express.static(): Serve static files (like images) from a specific directory.

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req,file,cb){
        cb(null,"public/assets")//cb - call back function
    },
    filename: function(req,file,cb){
        cb(null,file.originalname)
    }
});
const upload = multer({storage})

Explanation
In summary, this code sets up multer to handle file uploads with a disk storage engine. Uploaded files will be stored in the "public/assets" directory, and their names will be retained as their original names. The upload constant is a configured multer instance that can be used as middleware in the Express application to process file uploads. For example, you might use it in a route handling function to handle file uploads when a user submits a form with a file input.

6. .then(()=>{
    app.listen(PORT,()=>console.log(`Server Port: ${PORT}`))
}).catch((error)=>console.log(`${error} did not connect`))

Explanation

.then(() => { ... }): This part is executed if the database connection is successful. It means that the application can now listen for incoming requests.
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(Server Port: ${PORT})): This line starts the application and listens on a specified port (PORT). When the server is successfully started, it logs a message to the console, indicating the server is running.
.catch((error) => console.log(${error} did not connect)): This part is executed if there is an error in connecting to the database. It logs an error message to the console, indicating that the connection was not successful.

7. app.post("/auth/register",upload.single("picture"),register) // "/auth/register" is a route defined in the server

 The purpose of this line of code is to set up an endpoint/ending for user registration. When a user submits a registration form (presumably with fields like username, email, password, and a picture file), this route is triggered. The Multer middleware (upload.single("picture")) takes care of handling the file upload for the user's profile picture, 
 then the register function (asynchronus function) is called to perform the actual registration process, including storing user data in a database.

In summary, this line of code defines the route, specifies middleware to handle file uploads, and sets up a callback function (register) to process the user registration when a POST request is made to "/auth/register." 

The upload.single("picture") middleware is applied to the registration route. This middleware tells Multer to expect a single file upload with the field name "picture" in the request. The uploaded file will be processed by Multer using the specified storage configuration.
